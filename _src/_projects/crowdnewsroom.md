**CrowdNewsroom** aims to be a platform to provide distributed, non-document-based investigations. The software allows registered users to enter non-structured data to specific topics and questions. They can upload source files to prove their contributions. A fact-checking procedure allows editors to confirm or refuse the data gathered by the crowd.

It was used at correctiv.org for a crowd-driven [investigation for savings banks](https://correctiv.org/recherchen/sparkassen/) in cooperation with the [Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/finanzen/sparkassen-check/).

Another investigation with this toolbox took place in early 2017 in Dortmund, Germany. Together with the [RuhrNachrichten](http://ruhrnachrichten.de) we did an investigation about public schools. [Pupils, their parents and teachers collected data about cancelled lessons](http://unterrichtsausfall-check.de).

The software itself consists of different tools and apps that can be combined independently. It's written in [python](https://python.org) and powered by [the django framework](https://djangoproject.com).

The **CrowdNewsroom** won (among another project from correctiv.org) the german ["Reporterpreis" in category innovation.](http://www.reporter-forum.de/index.php?id=229)
