[Tania Röttger](https://twitter.com/TanRoet) from correctiv.org and Open-News fellow [Sandhya Kambhampati](https://twitter.com/sandhya__k) collected tons of datapoints about mini-jobbers (low wage, no benefits) in germany.

I did some maps and bars to show the main aspects of the data.

For example [this interactive "double-map"](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) that compares the relative amount of women working in minijobs against men. This was done with [riotjs](http://riotjs.com) and [d3js](http://d3js.org).

[Another map](https://correctiv.org/recherchen/arbeit/artikel/2017/08/01/so-viele-minijobber-wohnen-deiner-gemeinde/) was implemented with [mapbox-gl]() with a neat fallback for non-supported devices:

For our cooperation partners located in different regions and states all around germany, [we provided the raw data for download](https://correctiv.org/recherchen/arbeit/artikel/2017/08/01/minijobs-daten-fuer-kooperationspartner/), but still in a fashioned way:
